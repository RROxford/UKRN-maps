# UKRN-maps

Code to produce maps of the UK showing the location of UKRN institutions and/or local networks.

The code:

1. downloads a `csv` file with locations of UK higher education institutions
2. selects the relevant institutions and local networks
3. prints maps

Three different maps can be produced: both institutions and local
networks, institutions, and local networks. These can be saved to the
repository with a transparent background, with a name that includes
the date the map was produced.
